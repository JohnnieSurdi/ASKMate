# AskMate (sprint 2)

## Story

Last week you created a pretty good site from scratch. It already has some features but it's a bit difficult to maintain due to the fact that the data is stored in CSV files. Some new features are also needed, to make the site more usable and more appealing to users.

The management decided to move further as users requested new features, such as the ability to comment on answers and tag questions (and of course the issue with CSV files). There are several other feature requests which you can find in the user stories.

Just like last week, management is handing out a **prioritized list** of new user stories that you must add to the unfinished stories from last week on your product backlog. Try to estimate these new stories as well, and, based on the estimations, decide how many of them your team can finish until the demo. As the order is important, you must choose from the beginning of the list as much as you can.

## What are you going to learn?

- Use `psycopg2` to connect to a PostgreSQL database from Python.
- Understand basic SQL commands (`SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`).
- Understand CSS basics.
- Work according to the Scrum framework,
- Create a _sprint plan_.

## Tasks

1. Since you work in a new repository, but also need the code from the previous sprint, add the `ask-mate-2` repository as a new remote to the repository of the previous sprint, then pull (merge) and push your changes into it.
    - There is a merge commit in the project repository that contains code from the previous sprint.

2. Make the application use a database instead of CSV files.
    - The application uses a PostgreSQL database instead of CSV files.
    - The application respects the `PSQL_USER_NAME`, `PSQL_PASSWORD`, `PSQL_HOST` and `PSQL_DB_NAME` environment variables.
    - The database structure (tables) is the same as in the provided SQL file (`sample_data/askmatepart2-sample-data.sql`).

3. Allow the user to add comments to a question.
    - There is a `/question/<question_id>/new-comment` page.
    - The page is linked from the question page.
    - There is a form with a `message` field, and it issues `POST` requests.
    - After submitting, the page redirects to the question detail page, and the new comment appears together with its submission time.

4. Allow the user to add comments to an answer.
    - There is a `/answer/<answer_id>/new-comment` page.
    - The page is linked from the question page, next to or below the answer.
    - There is a form with a `message` field, and it issues `POST` requests.
    - After submitting, the page redirects to the question detail page, and the new comment appears together with its submission time.

5. Implement searching in questions and answers. (Hint: [Passing data from browser](https://learn.code.cool/web-python/#/../pages/web/passing-data-from-browser))

    - There is a search box and "Search" button on the main page.
    - When writing something and pressing the button, a results list of questions is displayed (with the same data as in the list page).
    - The results list contains questions for which the title or description contain the searched phrase.
    - The results list also contains questions which have answers for which the message contains the searched phrase.
    - The results list URL is `/search?q=<search phrase>`.

6. Allow the user to edit the posted answers.
    - There is a `/answer/<answer_id>/edit` page.
    - The page is linked from the answer page.
    - There is a form with a `message` field, and it issues a `POST` request.
    - The field is pre-filled with existing answer data.
    - After submitting, the page redirects to the question detail page, and the answer is updated.

7. Allow the user to edit comments.
    - The page URL is `/comment/<comment_id>/edit`.
    - There is a link to the edit page next to each comment.
    - The page contains a `POST` form with a `message` field.
    - The field pre-filled with current comment message.
    - After submitting, the page redirects to the question detail page, and the new comment appears.
    - The submission time is updated.
    - There is a message that says "Edited `<number_of_editions>` times." next to or below the comment.

8. Allow the user to delete comments.
    - There is a recycle bin icon next to the comment.
    - Clicking the icon asks the user to confirm the deletion.
    - The deletion itself is implemented by the `/comments/<comment_id>/delete` endpoint (which does not ask for confirmation anymore).
    - After deleting, the page redirects to the question detail page, and the comment is not shown anymore.

9. Display five latest questions on the main page (`/`).
    - The main page (`/`) displays the five latest submitted questions.
    - The main page contains a link to all of the questions (`/list`).

10. Implement sorting for the question list. [If you did this user story in the previous sprint, now you only have to rewrite it to use SQL.]
    - The question list can be sorted by title, submission time, message, number of views, and number of votes.
    - The list can be sorted in ascending and descending order.
    - The order is passed as query string parameters, for example `/list?order_by=title&order_direction=desc`.

11. Add tags to questions.
    - The tags are displayed on the question detail page.
    - There is an "add tag" link which leads to the page for adding a tag.
    - The URL for the page for adding a tag has is `/question/<question_id>/new-tag`.
    - The page allows to choose from existing tags or define a new one.

12. Highlight the search phrase in the search results.
    - On the search results page, the searched phrase is highlighted.
    - If the phrase is found in an answer, the answer is also displayed (slightly indented).
    - The search phrase is also highlighted in the answers.

13. Allow the user to delete tags from questions.
    - There is an X link next to each tag.
    - Clicking that link deletes the tag and reloads the question page.
    - The deletion is implemented as `/question/<question_id>/tag/<tag_id>/delete` endpoint.

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- It's important that if the database table has a timestamp column then you cannot insert a UNIX timestamp value directly into that table, you should use:
    - either strings in the following format '1999-01-08 04&colon;05&colon;06',
    - or if you use psycopg2 and the datetime module, you can pass a datetime object to the SQL query as parameter (details in the background materials: [Date/Time handling in psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/usage.html?highlight=gunpoint#date-time-objects-adaptation))
- Pay attention on the order of inserting data into the tables, because you may violate foreign key constraints (that means e.g. if you insert data into the question_tag before you insert into the tag table the corresponding tag id you want to refer to then it won't exist yet)!
- You can import the sample data file into `psql` with the `\i` command or run it via the Database tool in PyCharm.
- Some user stories may require to deal with CSS as well, but do not deal with CSS too much. It's more important that you write proper queries, have a working connection with psycopg2, have a clean Python code than create an amazingly beautiful web application (although if you have time, of course it's not forbidden to do so :smiley:).

### Data models

All data should be persisted in a PostgreSQL database in the following tables (you can ignore data in the not implemented fields):

# AskMate (sprint 1)

## Story

It is time to put your newly acquired Flask skills to use.
Your next big task is to implement a crowdsourced Q&A site, similar to Stack Overflow.

The initial version of the site must be able to handle questions and answers.
There is no need for additional functionality, such as user management or comments for questions and answers.

The management is very interested in the agile development methodologies that they recently heard about, so they are handing out a **prioritized list** of user stories, called a product backlog. Try to estimate how many of these stories your team can finish until the demo. As the order is important, choose from the beginning of the list as much as you can. **The first four stories are the most important**.

## What are you going to learn?

- Create a Flask project.
- Use routes with Flask.
- Use HTML and the Jinja templating engine.
- CSV handling.

## Tasks

1. Implement the `/list` page that displays all questions.
    - The page is available under `/list`.
    - The data is loaded and displayed from `question.csv`.
    - The questions are sorted by most recent.

2. Create the `/question/<question_id>` page that displays a question and the answers for it.
    - The page is available under `/question/<question_id>`.
    - There are links to the question pages from the list page.
    - The page displays the question title and message.
    - The page displays all answers to a question.

3. Implement a form that allows the user to add a question.
    - There is an `/add-question` page with a form.
    - The page is linked from the list page.
    - There is a POST form with at least `title` and `message` fields.
    - After submitting, the page redirects to "Display a question" page of this new question.

4. Implement posting a new answer.
    - The page URL is `/question/<question_id>/new-answer`.
    - The question detail page links to the page.
    - The page has a POST form with a form field called `message`.
    - Posting an answer redirects to the question detail page. The new answer is displayed on the question detail page.

5. Implement sorting for the question list.
    - The question list can be sorted by title, submission time, message, number of views, and number of votes.
    - The question list can be put in ascending and descending order.
    - The order is passed as query string parameters, such as `/list?order_by=title&order_direction=desc`.

6. Implement deleting a question.
    - Deleting is implemented by the `/question/<question_id>/delete` endpoint.
    - There is a deletion link on the question page.
    - Deleting redirects to the list of questions.

7. Allow the user to upload an image for a question or answer.
    - The forms for adding question and answer contain an "image" file field.
    - The user can attach an image (.jpg, .png).
    - The image is saved on server and displayed next to the question or the answer.
    - When deleting the question or answer, the image file is also deleted.

8. Implement editing an existing question.
    - There is a `/question/<question_id>/edit` page.
    - The page is linked from the question page.
    - There is a POST form with at least `title` and `message` fields.
    - The fields are pre-filled with existing question data.
    - After submitting, the page redirects to the "Display a question" page. The changed data is visible on the "Display a question" page.

9. Implement deleting an answer.
    - Deleting is implemented by `/answer/<answer_id>/delete` endpoint.
    - There is a deletion link on the question page, next to an answer.
    - Deleting redirects to the question detail page.

10. Implement voting on questions.
    - Vote numbers are displayed next to questions on the question list page.
    - There are "vote up/down" links next to questions on the question list page.
    - Voting uses `/question/<question_id>/vote_up` and `/question/<question_id>/vote_down` endpoints.
    - Voting up increases, voting down decreases the `vote_number` of the question by one.
    - Voting redirects to the question list.

11. Implement voting on answers.
    - Vote numbers are displayed next to answers on the question detail page.
    - There are "vote up/down" links next to answers.
    - Voting uses `/answer/<answer_id>/vote_up` and `/answer/<answer_id>/vote_down` endpoints.
    - Voting up increases, voting down decreases the `vote_number` of the answer by one.
    - Voting redirects to the question detail page.

## General requirements

- All data is persisted to `.csv` files. You need a `questions.csv` for storing all questions and an `answers.csv` for storing all answers.

## Hints

 ### Project structure

- Split the code into modules according to clean code principles.
- Do not put more than 100-150 lines of code into a single file.
- Make sure that files logically contain the same things. For example,
you can split the code into the following 3+1 parts.

**Layer** | **Example filename** | **What should it do/contain?**
---|---|---
Routing layer | `server.py` | This layer contains logic related to Flask, such as server, routes, request handling, session, and so on. This is the only file to be imported from Flask.
Persistence layer | `data_manager.py` | This is the layer between the server and the data. Functions here are called from `server.py` and use generic functions from `connection.py`.
CSV _(later SQL)_ connection layer |  `connection.py` | This layer contains common functions to read, write, or append CSV files without feature-specific knowledge. Only this layer can access long term data storage. In this case, CSV files are used as storage, later this will switch to SQL databases.
- Utility "layer" | `util.py` | Helper functions that can be called from any other layer, but mainly from the business logic layer.

This is just one way to structure code, you do not have to follow it _strictly_.

### Data models

In the `sample_data` folder, there are two sample files for questions and answers.

The content of the files is the following (you can ignore data in the unimplemented fields).

**question.csv**<br>
*id:* A unique identifier for the question.<br>
*submission_time:* The UNIX timestamp when the question is posted.<br>
*view_number:* The number of times this question is displayed in the single question view.<br>
*vote_number:* The sum of votes this question receives.<br>
*title:* The title of the question.<br>
*message:* The question text.<br>
*image:* The path to the image for this question.<br>

**answer.csv**<br>
*id:* A unique identifier for the answer.<br>
*submission_time:* The UNIX timestamp when the answer is posted.<br>
*vote_number:* The sum of votes the answer receives.<br>
*question_id:* The ID of the question to which this answer belongs.<br>
*message:* The answer text.<br>
*image:* The path to the image for this answer.<br>
